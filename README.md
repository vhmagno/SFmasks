# SFmasks
Stock and flow models showcasing different scenarios with circular strategies to analyze their impacts on the mask lifecycle. 
This repository contains stock and flow models designed to illustrate different scenarios with circular strategies for analyzing their impacts. The project aims to explore and evaluate various approaches to the lifecycle of masks, from usage to disposal and recycling. By implementing circular economy principles, these models provide insights into resource efficiency, environmental benefits, and supply chain improvements.
